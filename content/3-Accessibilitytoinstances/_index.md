(In this section, you will connect AWS Config and AWS Security Hub to your AWS network resources, and begin collecting compliance evaluation results. This process allows you to automatically detect non-compliant configurations, store audit logs, and prepare data for analysis and reporting.)

By the end of this section, you will have:

AWS Config continuously evaluating resources against selected compliance frameworks.

Security Hub aggregating findings across multiple services.

Audit logs stored in S3 for later analysis with Athena and QuickSight.
