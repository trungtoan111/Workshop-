## Network Compliance & Audit Automation

**Network Compliance & Audit Automation** is an always-on solution that continuously monitors AWS network resources, checks them against industry frameworks (SOC 2, PCI DSS, HIPAA), and **auto-remediates** anything that drifts out of policy. It stitches together AWS-native services — **AWS Config, Security Hub, CloudTrail, Athena, Lambda, and QuickSight** — to deliver end-to-end compliance checks, log auditing, and reporting at cloud scale.

### Why it matters
Manual audits are slow, error-prone, and blind to real-time risk. This approach keeps your environment compliant **24/7**, proves it with an audit trail, and fixes issues automatically before they become incidents.

### Key benefits
- **Continuous monitoring** – Evaluate VPCs, subnets, route tables, SGs, NACLs, endpoints, and load balancers around the clock.  
- **No manual overhead** – Replace periodic checklists with automated, policy-based assessments.  
- **Centralized enforcement** – Manage rules and remediation logic in one place with **AWS Config** + **Lambda**.  
- **Real-time auto-remediation** – Instantly correct violations (e.g., enforce S3 encryption, tighten Security Group ingress).  
- **Full audit trail** – Persist findings, changes, and remediation actions to **Amazon S3** with **CloudTrail** evidence.  
- **Visual reporting** – Track posture and trends via **QuickSight** dashboards.  
- **Framework flexibility** – Extend with new frameworks or custom rules as regulations evolve.  
- **Cost efficiency** – Cut external audit effort and downtime from misconfigurations.

**Bottom line:** a proactive, scalable way to maintain security and regulatory alignment across your AWS network — with proof on demand.
